# Bikesharing
## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis, we were tasked with using Tableau to look into investing in a bikesharing venture in the city of Des Moines Iowa. To aid us in our decision-making, we pulled data from the New York [Citi Bike System Data](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) page, which contains donwloadable files of Citi Bike tip data. For this analysis, we looked at data taken in August of 2019. We used python to put the data into the desired data types and then utilized Tableau for the visualization.
