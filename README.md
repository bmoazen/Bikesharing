# Bikesharing
## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis, we were tasked with using Tableau to look into investing in a bikesharing venture in the city of Des Moines Iowa. To aid us in our decision-making, we pulled data from the New York [Citi Bike System Data](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) page, which contains donwloadable files of Citi Bike tip data. For this analysis, we looked at data taken in August of 2019. We used python to put the data into the desired data types and then utilized Tableau for the visualization.

## Results of the Analysis
Here is a link to the [Tableau Workbook](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brian.moazen/viz/citibikeData_201908/TripsbyAgeandGender).

Shown below is a breakdown of the proportion of NYC citibike riders by ages and gender.  The peaks for both female and male occur in the 25-35 year age range.  The median ages of Des Moines residents is currently 34.2 years (male) and 33.4 years (female) ([Source: World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/des-moines-ia-population)), which translates well, especially considering the NYC median ages are 38.1 and 35.4 for females and males, respectively.  This suggests that the similarity bewteen the Des Moines and New York City age demographics make  comparisons between them reasonable.
